Hello. You are looking at a computer screen. \
Unless you are looking at a phone or tablet screen. \
Or perhaps you've hooked up a television to your computer. \
Or perhaps someone has printed the readme on paper. \
Or perhaps some other medium for the transmission of written language. \
Or perhaps someone is reading it to you. \
Perhaps that someone is indeed not a person at all, but rather a text-to-speech program. \
Perhaps you know this text-to-speech program as Siri, or Cortana. \
Perhaps you even know it as "whatever the hell Google's assistant is named". \
Yes, perhaps. \
Or perhaps this isn't even being read to you at all, \
But described in the abstract - \
Be it through interpretive dance, or perhaps cubist painting. \
Perhaps it is a melody whose notes resonate to your core, \
Or perhaps it is a drum solo whose beats serve as inspiration for your very being! \
... perhaps. \
Or perhaps it is a whisper, \
An unspoken connection, \
Emotion manifesting tangible in the air, \
A knowing look between lovers, \
Or a joke told in a glance between friends. \
... \
No, it's probably a computer screen. \
